title: 'Harvest: Scott''s OG, Sour Diesel, & Night Terror OG'
---

Been awhile since the last update on these ladies! They have been harvested,
dried, and mostly cured! Here are the last photos of them before harvest (about
11 days prior):

When it was time, I snuck in a couple hours before the lights came on and hacked
away and the mainstems - and boy do I mean hacked! These plants remained in a
vegetative state a little longer than I had planned, and had quite the thick
trunks to cut through - with an extremely sharp (and serrated) knife, my pruning
shears, heavy duty pliers with a wire cutter, and some elbow grease, I managed
to separate each plant from it's roots. I prefer to do everything in the dark
so that the plant doesn't have the chance to "wakeup" and start drawing up
water (and stored nutrients) from its root system, as this can negatively impact
flavor and smoke quality.

Next, I separated each stem from the main branch of the two heftier ladies -
such that it's easier to keep the buds from touching each other during hang
drying.

The littlest lady, Sour Diesel, was kept whole for the time being, to prevent
over-drying her smaller buds. Everything was hung in a spare tent, which was
connected to a spare fan and an old carbon filter.

After a day, it was time to do some further processing. Here are the previously
separated Scott's OG and Night Terror OG branches:

You can see the leaves have begun to wilt. When you cut down the plant, it
doesn't just instantly die - it remains metabolically active to a limited
degree. For this reason, I prefer to leave the leaves for a short spell - in
case they may be of further use for the plant. This also helps keep the buds
from drying too fast - we want everything from here out to be slow and steady.

I'll trim the largest fan leaves at this point. These are the leaves with
a visible gap separating their stem from the branch they are attached to.

I don't bother to collect these leaves - they have too low of a "sugar"
(trichome) to leaf ratio to be worth processing (i.e. they would yield a low
quality extract).

I also went ahead and broke down the previously still-attached-to-main-stem
Sour Diesel at this point, leaving behind one of my favorites during harvest,
the wonderful cannabis Christmas tree.

After two more days in the drying tent, it was time to start placing the buds
in jars, and closely monitoring their humidity levels. Except, I was going to
be out of town!

The worst possible outcome for a legal grow which makes it to harvest day is
mold. That's because it can transform a highly-valuable product into complete
garbage overnight. With this fear in mind, I didn't want to leave the buds in
jars without being able to monitor for (and release) any moisture buildup. So,
I ventured into new territory: freezer curing.

A (much) colder temperature allows me to slow down the curing process, without
worrying about mold - while leaving the bud in paper bags still allows for some
air exchange to take place. The buds were dry enough at this point (after 3
days) that there would be no ice formations after freezing (which leads to mushy
bud after thawing).

So off I went for a little over a week, and returned to check on my frozen buds.

To my relief, everything still looked great! So I finished the final trim,
and put the buds in jars to finish curing, along with a hygrometer to monitor
the RH (relative humidity).

After a few days, I noticed both the Scott's OG and Night Terror OG were much
dryer than I had planned - hovering between 50-52%. Odd, I thought, they didn't
feel that dry while trimming. Not willing to accept quality lower than I could
help, I decided to order a few Boveda 62 packs, which would help raise the RH
in the jars to 62%, and stabilize it there.

Once the packs arrived, I kept noticing similar readings on my hygrometer -
which eventually stabilized at 49%. "Is it so dry that I need more packs?", I
wondered.

But before I added more, it hit me - hygrometers are renowned for being
inaccurate. So I dropped mine into the Boveda 62 bag, complete with 6 unused
packs, and waited. And sure enough, it plateaued at 49%. Now I knew my
hygrometer was 13 points off!

Fortunately, I'm able to calibrate it easily, and was able to dial it in to
62% exactly.

It's worth noting that while Boveda does sell a "calibration pack", the
technical difference between it and regular packs comes down to the degree of
accuracy - with the calibration packets being accurate to within 0.5%, and with
the regular packets only being accurate to within 1%. For me, and for most
people curing cannabis, I'm sure this isn't a deal-breaker. The equipment we're
calibrating likely already has it's own even greater limitations on accuracy.

After a few weeks of curing, there's very little change left to take place in
the buds outside of the smell, which will strengthen and continue to develop in
complexity.

The last place award at the weigh-in, to no surpise, was Sour Diesel. At just
over 3/4 of an ounce (21.6g), it was largely a disappointment. First of all,
it wasn't genetics that I sought - but instead was a free seed planted as a
backup, since it was feminized and the other seeds being planted were unsexed.
Second, as the shortest plant, it was quickly dwarfed during flower by it's
much taller neighbors.

There are only a few choice Sour Diesel buds, with the rest being popcorn. The
smell isn't particularly strong yet, and they aren't all that frosty. But so
goes last place.

Runner up of the pageant is Scott's OG, weighing in a little shy of 2 ounces
(53.5g). I'm reasonably happy with this plant, but given the amount of space it
took up, I would've preferred genetics with slightly fatter buds. If I were to
continue to grow this strain, I would choose a different seed as the mother of
her future progeny.

They did grow quite frosty, and are presenting a lemon-pine aroma with a hint
of fuel.

And the breadwinner, Night Terror OG, set a new personal single plant record
for me at a couple grams shy of 2.5 ounces (68.2g). I attribute this extra heft
to a variety of factors, from an extended veg period, to switching to coco coir,
to dialing in my nute schedule a little better, and finally to good genetics.
She was also the frostiest of the three, but by only a slight margin over
Scott's OG.

She has the strongest smell of the three so far as well, a wonderfully pungent
blueberry aroma, which comes from her Blue Dream lineage, but shines through
even stronger in this strain in my opinion.
