Ghost Train Haze will be the fifth [Rare Dankness](http://raredankness.com/)
strain that I've grown thus far. I first took notice of them after smoking this
strain. Hopefully I can do it justice.

Since there are only two plants in flower at the moment, Ghost Train Haze will
be moving into that tent in about 4 weeks. Skywalker Kush & Ayahuasca Purple,
on the other hand, will have to wait until the current tenants vacate in order
to begin flowering. I'll have to keep a careful eye on them and prune regularly
to keep their height in check during the upcoming 7 weeks or so of vegetative
growth.
