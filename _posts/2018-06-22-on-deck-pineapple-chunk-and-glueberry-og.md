title: 'On deck: Pineapple Chunk and Glueberry OG'
---

Just popped a couple new feminized seeds -
[Pineapple Chunk](https://www.barneysfarm.com/pineapple-chunk-15){:rel='noopener', :target='_blank'}, and
[Glueberry OG](https://www.dutch-passion.com/en/cannabis-seeds/product/glueberry-og-feminized-cannabis-seeds/){:rel='noopener', :target='_blank'}.
First, I soaked my Grodan cubes in pH-adjusted water (to ~5.5) for an hour or so.

Next, I placed each seed in it's corresponding cube, and put them somewhere warm.

It was too warm, actually - I had to re-wet the Grodan cubes too often - so I
moved them below the lights instead of above, and after a couple days, they
sprouted.

I would normally use a Solo cup at this stage, but as I've been so in love with
net pots lately, I decided to leap frog the keg-companion in favor of my
smallest (but still signficantly larger) net pot. We'll see how this does in
comparison - I'm hoping the increased container breathability outweighs the
excessive size and translates to more oxygen to the root zone. Until they
grow into this size, I'll be trying to limit the area of the pot which is
watered.

It's still quite a ways away, but I'm looking forward to testing out these new
strains! In the meantime, I'll just enjoy watching them grow up big and stinky.
Smell ya later!
