title: 'Day 52 of Flower: Pineapple Chunk and Glueberry OG'
---

We're midway through week 8 of flowering for these gals and things have
progressed nicely.

Despite it's previous struggles,
[Glueberry OG](https://www.dutch-passion.com/en/cannabis-seeds/product/glueberry-og-feminized-cannabis-seeds/){:rel='noopener'}{:target='_blank'}
is still continuing to beef up.

Though short, it's at least becoming stout.

I've already begun flushing it and will be harvesting soon. I'll probably cure
the main bud and make bubble hash with the rest.

[Pineapple Chunk](https://www.barneysfarm.com/pineapple-chunk-15){:rel='noopener'}{:target='_blank'}
has continued to put on some more weight, although not quite as much frost as I
would have hoped for at this late stage. I'm planning harvest after around week
9 of flower, which leaves me flushing pretty soon.

She has started to mature many more of her pistils in the last few days, except
for the main cola, where almost all of them are still bright white and standing
tall!

Looks like she still needs some time - could run longer than I'm expecting. Time
will tell.

As for now, I'll at least be enjoying the delightful smell.
