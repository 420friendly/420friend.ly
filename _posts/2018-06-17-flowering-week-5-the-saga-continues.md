title: 'Flowering, week 5: the saga continues'

Things are picking up quickly, particularly for the heaviest eater of the three,
[Night Terror OG](http://www.raredanknessgenetics.com/Seeds/KUSH/NightTerrorOG.htm){:rel='noopener'}{:target='_blank'} (far right):

And what was that I said about week 4 being the expected end of vertical growth?

Looks like this pheno leans heavy to the sativa side. That's why we have string.

Here she is with the ~~disco~~ grow lights off, in all of her terrible camera
phone flash glory:

You can hardly see lady

anymore. She was always the shortest of the three, and once the stretch of flower
began she was quickly tucked away beneath the canopy of her suitemates. Only a few
of her colas get unobstructed light, so she likely won't be able produce a whole
lot.

Responsible for stealing much of her light is my front runner,
[Night Terror OG](http://www.raredanknessgenetics.com/Seeds/KUSH/NightTerrorOG.htm){:rel='noopener'}{:target='_blank'}.
She has been packing on weight for some time now, and is glistening with trichomes.
She is so sticky at this point that I try to avoid touching her as much as I can
... it's pretty difficult to wash that resin off once it gets on your fingers.
Gloves are going to be a must here when it comes time to trim. No arguments here.

Looking forward to week 6!
