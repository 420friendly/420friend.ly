It's the start of week 6 of flowering for Skywalker Kush (left) and Ayahuasca
Purple (right).

[Skywalker Kush](https://dnagenetics.com/skywalker-kush.html){:rel='noopener'}{:target='_blank'}
has a pretty decent canopy going, though it was crowded out
slightly during the stretch of early flower when its neighbor really took off.

Though not the tallest cannabis plant, she's been beefing up nicely and has
some pretty good sized colas thus far. It's hard for me to describe the smell,
though not hard for me to identify it - she has the traditional Skywalker smell,
however you describe that. It's a bit sour, kind of chem-y, and slightly musky -
overall extremely pleasant.

[Ayahuasca Purple](https://www.barneysfarm.com/ayahuasca-purple-18){:rel='noopener'}{:target='_blank'}
has been quite the beast in overall size, but has produced fairly thin colas
so far for my tastes. There is certainly an abundance of them, however - so much
so that it's getting difficult to move the plant in and out of the grow tent.

While she has been far from my favorite strain to grow, she still has me quite
enticed due largely to her surprising aroma. The odor was slow to come in early
flower but is definitely getting stronger each week, and is a very peculiar
spicy, earthy, sweet smell - almost like peppered caramel, whatever that might
smell like!

I'll definitely be looking forward to sampling this oddball strain once she
finishes - and already know I will be enjoying the classic combo of Skywalker &
OG Kush! Just a few weeks to go until harvest!
