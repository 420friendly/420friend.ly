title: 'Now pouring: compost tea'
---

Just finished dishing out some homeade compost tea brewed special for my cannabis plants. I started with dechlorinated water, to which I added as many sources of plant microbes as I had available to me, including:

* Fox Farms Microbe Brew
* Fox Farms Kangaroots Root Drench
* Fox Farms Boomerang
* Mammoth Microbes

And then some food for the bacteria, fungi, and other fun friends I want to colonize:

* Molasses
* Fox Farms Big Bloom
* Fox Farms Wholly Mackerel
* Fox Farms Bembe
* Fox Farms Kelp Me Kelp You

That's a lot of products! But you can't have compost tea without compost, so into the bubble bucket goes some Eko organic compost, suspended by a 400 micron filter like a ... well, tea bag. A biodiverse input yields a biodiverse output!

After some time to brew, the concoction is ready, but weighs in at a surprisingly high ppm on my meter. Since I forgot to measure the liquid prior to brewing (whoops), it's unclear how much of that concentration is extracted nutrients from my compost, and how much is from an increase in the very microbes I had hoped to grow. So, to lessen the likelihood of any overfeeding, I dilute down my solution to a still reputable 2000 ppm.

All my cannabis plants - and then all the household plants with the leftovers - seem to be pretty happy so far with the result.
