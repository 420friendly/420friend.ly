title: 'Flowering update: week 6'

Week 6 of flowering is now underway! The calyxes are swelling and the trichomes
are packing on. Best of yet, some of those trichomes are beginning to become
cloudy on the most developed of the three,

(far right). She'll definitely finish first.

On the far left is the still somewhat lanky
[Scott's OG](http://www.raredanknessgenetics.com/Seeds/KUSH/ScottsOG.htm){:rel='noopener'}{:target='_blank'}.
From other pictures I've seen, I believe she'll finish relatively thin and tall.
She's putting off wonderful pine and lemon odors at present.

[Sour Diesel](https://blimburnseeds.com/sour-diesel){:rel='noopener'}{:target='_blank'}
has started to pack on a little more weight for the few colas that reached the
canopy. Her sour chem smell is developing nicely as well.

And last but certainly not least,
[Night Terror OG](http://www.raredanknessgenetics.com/Seeds/KUSH/NightTerrorOG.htm){:rel='noopener'}{:target='_blank'}
has started to color in some of her pistils, and is looking as gorgeous as ever.
She has the most amazing aroma of blueberry & earth.

Late flower is definitely the most fun time to be around the ladies - looking
forward to a great week!
