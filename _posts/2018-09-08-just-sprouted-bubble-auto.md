title: 'Just sprouted: Bubble Auto'

Just sprouted a new seedling,
[Bubble Auto](https://www.femaleseeds.nl/en/p/auto-bubble-290){:rel='noopener'}{:target='_blank'}.

After a few days of hanging out in a moist Grodan cube, it finally emerged,
slowly but surely. As is often the case with seedlings, they make look stuck
or in need of assistance, but they most certainly do not.

It's common for newer growers to try to lend a helping hand to a seedling which
hasn't fully emerged yet, but you're more likely to do harm than good. The best
course of action is to just keep waiting. And soon enough, it makes its way out.

I don't typically grow autos, but chose this seed due to an unexpected hangup with
[Ghost Train Haze](http://www.raredanknessgenetics.com/Seeds/SATIVA/GhostTrainHaze1.htm){:rel='noopener'}{:target='_blank'} -
which was a male, as it turns out. About one week into
flower, he started showing his pollen sacs.

I had previously thought this was a feminized seed - so was shocked to see male
pollen sacs emerge instead of female pistils. Further inspection of my previous
order reveals that I actually ordered two regular seeds, not one feminized seed -
but having only noticed 1 in the pack, I assumed it was feminized (since I never
order less than 2 when unsexed).

But with only a little more than 10 weeks left in my schedule for this current
grow cycle, I wasn't going to have time to grow a new photoperiod strain - so I
reached for an auto I had lying around. According to the breeder, it should
finish in 70 days from seed. Happy to have lucked out to have it lying around,
else I would be harvesting one less plant come November.
