title: 'Day 39 of Flower: Pineapple Chunk and Glueberry OG'
---

Week 6 of flowering is underway and the buds are packing on some nice weight.

I've been having a serious issue with
[Glueberry OG](https://www.dutch-passion.com/en/cannabis-seeds/product/glueberry-og-feminized-cannabis-seeds/){:rel='noopener'}{:target='_blank'},
which has struggled to flower very well for me. It remained densely packed
instead of stretching during early flower, and has twisted many of its leaves.

I've given it a good flush (though it never had crazy high PPM) and have
switched it to
[Advanced Nutrients](https://www.advancednutrients.com/){:rel='noopener'}{:target='_blank'}
and it seems to be improving, but only some. I do not have high hopes for the
final outcome of this lady, but might as well see her through at this point.

[Pineapple Chunk](https://www.barneysfarm.com/pineapple-chunk-15){:rel='noopener'}{:target='_blank'},
on the other hand, is doing pretty darn swell. It's also getting some of the new
nutes - a switch I made largely due to struggles with calcium deficiency while
growing in coco coir, as evidenced by this plant's leaves. Since the switch,
it seems to be packing on weight nicely, which I largely attribute to Big Bud.
It's the last scheduled week for Big Bud before switching to Overdrive according
to a 9 week flower schedule - which I'm now estimating for this gal.

Not surprisingly, she has the most amazing pineapple, cheese, and skunk aroma -
I'll be looking forward to seeing how she finishes!
