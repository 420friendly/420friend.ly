title: 'Day 24 of Veg: Skywalker Kush, Ayahuasca Purple, & Ghost Train Haze'
---

These three gals have been humming along nicely since our last update. They are
now in week 4 of veg, and after topping have 4 primary shoots each at the top
of the canopy.

I recently switched to
[Advanced Nutrients](https://www.advancednutrients.com/){:rel='noopener', :target='_blank'}
instead of
[Fox Farm](https://foxfarmfertilizer.com/){:rel='noopener', :target='_blank'}
due to problems I've had with calcium deficiency while growing in coco coir
using the Fox Farm hydro lineup.

[Skywalker Kush](https://dnagenetics.com/skywalker-kush.html){:rel='noopener', :target='_blank'}:

They have been looking mostly good since the switch, and although I'm seeing
some slight deficiencies that are new, they've improved overall since. Those
deficiencies are likely due to nutrient lockout, as my runoff PPM was much
higher than expected - necessitating a good flush. Hopefully, Skywalker Kush's
leaves will start to unwrinkle a little further - she seems most affected in
that regard.

Looking forward, I'll be eager to pop Ghost Train Haze into the flower room
later this week - and to keep vegging the other two in order to have even bigger
flowering plants once they get their turn. Speaking of, those two are
going to need another good topping soon to make sure their height stays low for
an even canopy. Cheers to a great week 4!
